# Development Guide

Explodex is a source-first repo. Keep proprietary Codex bundles and extracted reverse-engineering output local and ignored.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `sdk/explodex-sdk.js` | Injected renderer SDK and plugin runtime |
| `plugins/<id>/plugin.json` | Plugin catalog metadata |
| `plugins/<id>/index.js` | Plugin runtime entrypoint |
| `scripts/cdp-inject.ts` | CDP injector (Bun TypeScript; shell entry `cdp-inject.sh`) |
| `scripts/dev.ts` | Local dev: package + chrome-devtools-mcp + launch |
| `scripts/package-app.ts` | Build the source-development `dist/Explodex.app` |
| `lib/launcher-bundle.mjs` | Generate the lightweight npm-installed launcher |
| `lib/platform/macos.mjs` | Installed-mode macOS launch state adapter |
| `scripts/launch.sh` | Launch Codex with remote debugging and inject Explodex |
| `templates/explodex-app/` | Tracked shell launcher template for the wrapper app |
| `dist/` | Ignored generated output (`dist/Explodex.app`) |

## Prerequisites

Node **≥ 22** is the target runtime (see `.node-version`) and **pnpm** is the primary package manager (`npm` also works). You do *not* need a system Bun — the repo installs Bun 1.3.14 as a devDependency into `node_modules/.bin` and every `pnpm run …` / `pnpm exec bun …` picks it up from there.

```sh
pnpm install        # or: npm install
```

> pnpm does not run dependency postinstall scripts by default; `package.json` allowlists Bun via `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies`, so `pnpm install` still lands a working `node_modules/.bin/bun`. On npm, `npm install` runs it natively.

## Local Development

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

This packages `dist/Explodex.app`, launches it, waits for debug port `9333`, and starts `chrome-devtools-mcp` for agent inspection (see `.mcp.json`).

The CDP injector applies the SDK/catalog to every matching Codex renderer target it sees during startup. After the first injection it keeps polling (every 250ms) for late-mounting secondary renderers but exits as soon as two consecutive polls find nothing new; `EXPLODEX_TARGET_WATCH_MS` (default `8000`) is only the absolute upper bound, so the common single-window case finishes in ~0.5s instead of waiting out the full window. Inside each renderer, SDK zones can be observed with `Explodex.observeZone(zoneId, callback)` so plugins can remount after React replaces a portal/sidebar node.

Re-inject after editing SDK or plugins:

```sh
pnpm run inject
```

The injector publishes the refreshed plugin catalog before evaluating the SDK.
The SDK initializes from that catalog during startup, so one injection both adds
new plugins and removes deleted plugin IDs without reloading the renderer.

### Layout snapshot (sidebar / shell landmarks)

After `pnpm run dev` (or any session with CDP on `9333`), capture a JSON layout
report for debugging selector drift:

```sh
pnpm exec bun scripts/cdp-layout-snapshot.ts
# optional explicit output path:
EXPLODEX_LAYOUT_SNAPSHOT_OUT=./layout.json pnpm exec bun scripts/cdp-layout-snapshot.ts
```

Default write path: `~/.explodex/snapshots/layout-<timestamp>.json`. The snapshot
includes sidebar testids, nav `aria-label`s, profile footer button, zone portal
presence, `data-app-action-sidebar-*` counts, and a short React fiber chain when
the DevTools hook is present.

### React layout probe via CDP

Codex ships production React. `cdp-react-devtools.ts` installs the DevTools global
hook (for reload) and immediately walks `__reactFiber$*` chains on sidebar DOM
nodes — no reload required for the fiber report:

```sh
pnpm run react-devtools
# optional: also attempt react-devtools-inline backend eval (needs renderer reload for UI)
EXPLODEX_REACT_DEVTOOLS_BACKEND=1 pnpm run react-devtools
```

Pair with `pnpm run layout:snapshot` when Codex changes layout between releases.

`pnpm run inject` (`--inject-only`) connects to whatever is listening on the debug port — including an SSH tunnel to a remote Codex. The **Explodex.app launcher** is stricter: it only takes the “inject into existing instance” fast path when **local** Codex owns port `9333` (or the process is otherwise identifiable as `Codex.app/Contents/MacOS/Codex`). If another process (e.g. `ssh -L 9333:…`) holds the port, the launcher reports a port conflict instead of falsely claiming injection into a running local Codex.

## Distribution boundary

Production distribution is through the npm registry and supports global installation with pnpm, Bun, npm, or Yarn. The generated user launcher is documented in [installation.md](./installation.md). `pnpm run package` and `dist/Explodex.app` remain source-development tools only.

## Validate

```sh
pnpm run validate
```

Checks shell syntax, Bun/TS syntax, JS entrypoints, JSON manifests, npm injector build, and launcher tests.

## Plugin Development

1. Create `plugins/<id>/plugin.json`.
2. Create `plugins/<id>/index.js`.
3. Register via `Explodex.plugins.register`.
4. Return a teardown that removes listeners, timers, observers, and mounted UI.
5. Run `pnpm run validate`.
6. Run `pnpm run inject` (or `pnpm run dev` for a fresh session).

Keep plugin state keys namespaced with `explodex-`. When renaming old keys, read legacy keys and write the new key on the next update.

### Use your local `plugins/` checkout

To run the plugins in your working copy instead of the bundled copies, either symlink your checkout into the user plugins directory (user plugins override bundled plugins with the same id):

```sh
ln -sf "$(pwd)/plugins" ~/.explodex/plugins
```

or point the user plugins directory at your repo:

```sh
export EXPLODEX_USER_PLUGINS_DIR="$(pwd)/plugins"
```

Then run `pnpm run inject` after editing plugin source.

## Browser Verification

`.mcp.json` configures `chrome-devtools-mcp` against `http://127.0.0.1:9333`. `pnpm run dev` starts that MCP server automatically. Cursor agents should use the chrome-devtools MCP tools after dev is running.

## Public Repo Hygiene

Do not commit:

- Codex app bundles
- Extracted app assets
- User data directories
- Logs
- Generated `dist/Explodex.app`

Do commit:

- SDK source
- plugin source and manifests
- scripts and templates
- docs
- validation gates
